AI Models Web Application
This project is a web application that allows users to interact with various AI models for tasks such as object identification, sentence completion, speech-to-text conversion, object detection, image captioning, text extraction, question answering, language translation, and grammar correction. It is built using Streamlit for the frontend, and pre-trained models from Hugging Face and other NLP/Computer Vision frameworks.

Features
The application provides the following functionalities:

Object Identification: Detects and identifies objects in an image using the BEiT model.
Sentence Completion: Completes sentences based on input using a pre-trained text generation model.
Speech-to-Text Conversion: Converts spoken words into text using audio input.
Object Detection: Identifies objects in images with bounding boxes.
Image Captioning: Generates captions for uploaded images.
Text Extraction: Extracts text from input images.
Question Answering: Answers questions based on a given passage.
Language Translation: Translates text between different languages.
Grammar Correction: Corrects grammatical errors in the input text.
Technology Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: Pre-trained models from Hugging Face's transformers, happytransformer, and other NLP/Computer Vision libraries.
Deployment: Streamlit Cloud with CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.8+
Pip
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Download NLTK Resources
The app relies on nltk for natural language processing tasks. You need to download additional NLTK resources such as punkt and stopwords.

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Step 4: Run the App
To start the Streamlit app, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The app will be accessible locally in your browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage
Object Identification
Upload an image file.
The app will identify objects using the BEiT model.
Sentence Completion
Input a partial sentence.
The model will complete the sentence.
Speech-to-Text Conversion
Record or upload an audio file.
The app will convert speech to text.
Image Captioning
Upload an image.
The app will generate a caption describing the image.
Text Extraction
Upload an image containing text.
The app will extract and display the text.
